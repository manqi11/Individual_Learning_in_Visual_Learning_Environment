# Individual_Learning_in_Visual_Learning_Environment
This project investigates 28,785 students' learning characteristics when studying STEM and Social Science courses though the online visual learning environment.

Online learning becomes an important tool for academic achievement and career development. 
There are ubiquitous individual differences in the abilities to learn a new subject. These differences are often derived from the internal individual learning characteristic (e.g. age, gender, learning habits, cognitive abilities), and external learning environment (e.g. materials, testing format, learning intervals, etc). Understand the users’ learning characteristics and how they affected by the online learning materials and settings can help the online course companies to develop better courses for the users and argument learning. 

In this project, I will analyze a public online learning dataset from the Open University (https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset). The dataset contains 28,785 students’ learning information in 7 courses in the social science and STEM fields. Specifically, I will investigate how  learning materials, assessment types, students’ engagement, age, gender, and educational level  predict their learning outcomes at the end of the 9-month learning.
